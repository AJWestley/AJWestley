- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJWestley
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (duh), but more specifically application and game developement (something I'm trying in my spare time) and any physics related programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my BSc in Computer Science and Physics where so far I am proficient in Java and am learning C, Python and will soon begin with Assembly.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking for any collaborations at the moment as I am focusing most of my energy towards my degree.
- 📫 However, I can still be reached at alexanderjwestley@gmail.com, should anyone wish to cantact me.
